## Background

This repository holds the code used to generate the results for the PhD thesis [Algorithms for reachability problems on stochastic Markov reward models](https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/11842/)).
It provides the `pymrm` package that can be used to solve stochastic markov reward models, for discrete-lattice problems as well as continuous problems.

## Tutorial

Whilst the theory of what SMRMs are can be found in the thesis, a practical example of how to use the python package
can be found under the `/examples` folder.
